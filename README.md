## Overview
### Description
This app will allow you to interact with other Marvel fans by discussing favored movies and scenes, 
share hype or disdain for trailers, and view a tribute to the late Stan Lee, founder of Marvel.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Media
- **Mobile:** This app would primarily be used for mobile devices. While it could function on a pc, it would most
likely have additional features on a mobile platform.
- **Story:** Connects Marvel fans together to share or discuss opinions in a public platform.
Users would be required to register an account to use the profile features such as friending other
fans.
- **Market:** This app would be best for persons older than 18, considering the toxicity that could arise from
differing opinions. Such negativity would not be appropriate for adolescence. While the forums would be monitered, there is not guarantee that inappropriate behavior would never occur.
- **Habit:** This app could be used anytime, however the best time would be after the announcement of a brand new Marvel movie.
- **Scope:** This would start as a simple forum/social media platform that could evolve to a hub for fan art and fan fics for
favorite Marvel cast members.
